To run a classification program with string as features in Python, you will need to convert the strings to numerical values that can be processed by a classification algorithm. There are several ways to do this, including:

Bag-of-words model: This is a commonly used technique for text classification, where each word in the text is treated as a feature, and the frequency of occurrence of each word is used as the numerical value. You can use the CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer class from the scikit-learn library to implement this.

Word embeddings: This is a more advanced technique that converts each word to a dense vector representation, which captures the semantic meaning of the word. You can use pre-trained word embeddings such as Word2Vec or GloVe, or train your own embeddings using libraries like Gensim.

Once you have converted the strings to numerical values, you can use any classification algorithm such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks to train your model. Here's an example code snippet to get you started with the bag-of-words model:
